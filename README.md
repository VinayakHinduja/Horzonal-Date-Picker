# Horizontal Date Picker

A Flutter widget that implements a horizontal date picker with a sliding interface. The picker displays 7 dates at a time, with the middle date selected, and allows scrolling through a yearâ€™s worth of dates (365 days). The selected date is highlighted with a blue dot, and the UI updates dynamically as the user scrolls.
